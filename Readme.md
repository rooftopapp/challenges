# RoofTop Coding Challenges

Hi, If you have received this test then we're likely in the process of chatting with you about a Developer role at Rooftop. In order to move forward, we'd like to know a little about how you work. 
There are folders with different skill-sets we are hiring for and each contains instructions that can demonstrate your skills and abilities in the perticular domain.
These are NOT coding exercises. The goal of these exercises is to give you an asynchronous medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into something akin to a rapid POC/spike. There is no grading or scoring, nor is it pass-fail, rather these are meant to serve a sample of your reductive thought processes as an engineer.

## **Why These Exercises?**

We know that the technical hiring processes in our industry are generally broken. We also know that there are mixed opinions on take-home exercises in general. The primary reasons we ask candidates of all levels to complete these exercises are as follows.

* These exercises allow you to show off your skills at a time/place that works for you.
* Take-home exercises allow you to work at your own pace. We intentionally structure these to take around 3-4ish hours of time and ask that you limit your investment to no more than the suggested time, however,  you are free to break this into as many sessions as you wish.
* It matches the nature of our work. Most of being an engineer on a remote team is a self-directed exploration of a problem, followed by period(s) of cyclic work/edit/review, followed by submission for review and approval by your peers. Async exercises allow you to do the same.
* It eliminates the performance anxiety of forced-pairing with someone whom you've just met.
* It allows you to use the tools, languages, and frameworks where you are the most productive.

## **General Instructions**
1. Read the instructions carefully and ask any clarifying questions either via Github issues or by emailing hr@rajasthanstudio.com
2. Create a new private repository for your exercise
3. Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 3-4 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the document
4. Be sure to include the following in your submission
    * README.md with the following information 
        * A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work!
        *  A short explanation of what you built
        *  How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
    
    **NOTE: A 'working' exercise is awesome, however, it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!**

    * Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
    * Anything else you'd like us to know about your submission
5. ROADMAP.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
6. A super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
7. Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)

When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to hr@rajasthanstudio.com
Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you as soon as possible.
