# Angular Challenge: Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

## Challenge Description
For this exercise, you'll be creating an interactive data visualization dashboard using Angular. This challenge is designed to showcase your advanced understanding of Angular's capabilities, including dynamic data loading, complex user interactions, and effective state management.

## Exercise Instructions
1. **Dashboard Setup:**
   - Create a dashboard that dynamically renders different data visualizations based on user-selected metrics.
   - Use a mock JSON file to simulate fetching data from an API. This file should contain several types of metrics that can be visualized (e.g., sales data, user engagement metrics, performance statistics).
2. **Features:**
   - Dynamic Component Loading: Implement a system where different visualization components (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) are loaded dynamically based on the user's selection.
   - State Management: Utilize NgRx to manage the state of the application, including data selections, current visualizations, and any filters applied.
   - Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard is responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices.
3. **User Interaction:**
   - Allow users to select which data metrics to display from a dropdown menu.
   - Provide options to customize the visualizations, such as changing the color scheme or adjusting the scale of graphs.
4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Write unit tests for your components and services.
   - Include a README.md file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application, a brief explanation of your design choices, and screenshots of the completed dashboard. 
5. **Bonus Challenges (Optional):**
   - Implement advanced chart features like zooming and panning.
   - Add user authentication to save personalized dashboard settings.
   - Use Angular Material to enhance the UI design.

## General Instructions
Refer to the [general instructions](../Readme.md) in the root directory for how to handle your submission.

## Anit-Requirements:
- Focus on the core functionalities; it's okay not to have a fully polished application.
- Don't worry about backend integrations; mock data can be used to simulate real scenarios.

## Ideal Stack
- Angular, NgRx, Angular Material (optional), any chart library that works with Angular (e.g., ngx-charts)
