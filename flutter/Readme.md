# Challenge 1

Before starting off check the [general instructions](../Readme.md) in the root directory

## I-Spy: Exercise Instruction
* Have you ever played [i-Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9d8_IDmNm0). We want to create a App version of the same
* What we expect from the App
    * We want to create a user by signing up
    * Show a list of online users once the username is set.
    * You can select one of the user and send him a picture using the camera. Which says "I spy with my little eye a thing starting with the letter <Any alphabet>".
    * The other user gets the image and draws a circle around something he thinks is a guess and sends it back to the initial user.
    * If correct they score a point they get 3 tries and the user who sent the first picture selects if its correct or not.
    * They can continue the game or quit.
* Be as creative as possible

## Anit-Requirements:
* You can't do it all. We respect your time and expect that you will have to make choices and tradeoffs for what is in scope for your deliverable.
* Don't worry about authentication. Assume a non-authenticated experience to keep things simple.
* Pick your stack. Choose any libraries that help you produce the highest quality work in the time available.

## Ideal Stack
* **Flutter**
